=== Electricity Billing System âš¡ ===

Scenario:

A power distribution company charges different rates for residential and commercial customers.

    - Residential customers are charged at $0.12 per unit.

    - Commercial customers are charged at $0.25 per unit.

    - The minimum bill should be $50 (even if usage is low).

    - If usage exceeds 1000 units, a 5% surcharge is added.

    - Negative or zero units should throw an error.


Expected Output:
Residential Bill: $120
Commercial Bill: $500
